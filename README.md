Shortpath-Simulator
===================

A short path algorithm simulator particularly Djikstra,Bellman-Ford, floyd-warshall, Astar.


The Graph was not made by me, I found it on the web. I just improved it. 
Added the color lines, Add the Report viewer at the side to show the shortest path and the code viewer also at the side. 
The algorithms, I researched it from the internet and modify it for it to work, though the astar aint yet done.
You can help me to fix the Astar, and if you may like, you may also add the genetics algorithm. 

And the software is done in .net 2008, so i think you can play it to 2008 or later version. also it is coded in C#. 
And also I think that you may just copy it from the root folder named Simulator.
